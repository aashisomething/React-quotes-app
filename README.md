# React + Vite with Quotes App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Quotes App

This project combines React with a simple quotes application.

Features include:

- Fetching quotes from an API
- Saving quotes
- Generating new quotes
- Using Tailwind CSS and Material-UI for design.
